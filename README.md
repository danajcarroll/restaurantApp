# FoodFind

FoodFind is an app that allows users to find the next restaurant they should eat at.

## Description

Using Vanilla JavaScript, this app uses objects to display all information to the user. Users are able to filter through restaurants, view restaurant information, and also view the restaurants menu. 

### Technologies Used
- HTML/CSS
- Vanilla JavaScript (forEach loops, DOM Manipulation, template literals, event listeners)

Using JavaScript Objects to populate all information on a web page was a first for me, but this definitely gave me a great bit of practice.

### Challenges
CSS Classes - With this project I was more strategic with how I assigned classes. This was beneficial when it came to styling objects similarly, and also styling objects differently when it came to different media queries.

Template Literals - These have changed everything! One particular challenge came about when 

Global Variables - When looking at my code now, I'm seeing that I think I could have been more strategic with how many variables I made in the global scope. My original intention was to minimize using 'document.getElementByID' all the time, but now seems counterintuitive as not many of them were reused across my script file. It didn't seem to create any problems with the application running, but after looking into issues that can occur (coupling, reassigning values etc.) it's something I'll think more about with my next app!
