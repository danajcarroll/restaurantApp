# FoodFind

FoodFind is an app that allows users to find the next restaurant they should eat at.

## Description

Using Vanilla JavaScript, this app uses objects to display all information to the user. Users are able to filter through restaurants, view restaurant information, and also view the restaurants menu. 

### Technologies Used
- HTML/CSS
- Vanilla JavaScript (forEach loops, DOM Manipulation, template literals, event listeners)

Using JavaScript Objects to populate all information on a web page was a first for me, but this definitely gave me a great bit of practice.
